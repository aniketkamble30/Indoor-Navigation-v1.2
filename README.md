# Indoor-Navigation-v1.2
The repository is under progress. Currently a virtual 3D model is being hosted using Cloud Anchors. This project is currently based on Sceneform and only works in Android because of the use of Android Studio.

Copy the files into a folder and name it CloudAnchors.

Copy the mini_project_resouces folder along with its contents.

Open the project into Android Studio and Run it on your mobile phone or Virtual Device (Like Pixel 2/ XL). 

Make sure the device you use has Oreo or above.
